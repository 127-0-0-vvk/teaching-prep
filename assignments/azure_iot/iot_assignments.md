### Answers


1)Azure IoT (Internet of Things) is used for connecting, monitoring, and managing IoT devices and assets. It provides a comprehensive platform to build, deploy, and scale IoT solutions, enabling organizations to gather data from diverse devices and utilize it for insights, automation, and optimization.

2)Examples of sensor devices used:

Temperature and humidity sensors for climate monitoring.
Motion sensors for occupancy detection and security applications.
Pressure sensors for industrial process monitoring.
GPS trackers for location-based services.
Light sensors for smart lighting control.
Proximity sensors for object detection in automation systems.

3)Role of Azure IoT Hub:
Azure IoT Hub acts as a central message broker and communication hub for IoT devices and applications. It enables bidirectional communication between IoT devices and the cloud, allowing devices to send telemetry data, receive commands, and handle device-to-cloud and cloud-to-device messaging. IoT Hub provides secure and scalable connectivity for managing a large number of IoT devices.


4)Azure IoT Central is a fully managed SaaS (Software as a Service) solution that simplifies the development, deployment, and management of IoT applications. With Azure IoT Central, you can:

Quickly create and deploy IoT solutions without extensive coding or infrastructure setup.
Connect, monitor, and manage IoT devices from a centralized dashboard.
Collect and analyze data from connected devices to gain insights and make data-driven decisions.
Implement workflows and automation based on real-time data from IoT devices.
Scale your IoT solution as your business needs grow
